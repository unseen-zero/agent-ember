## Security Warning

SwarmClaw can spawn **Claude Code CLI** processes with full shell access on your machine. This means agents can read, write, and execute anything your user account can. **Do not run this on a shared server or expose it to the public internet without understanding the risks.**

- Always use the access key authentication (generated on first run)
- Never expose port 3456 without a reverse proxy + TLS
- Review agent system prompts before giving them shell or browser tools

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 20+
- **npm** 10+
- **Claude Code CLI** (optional, for `claude-cli` provider) — [Install](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)
- **OpenAI Codex CLI** (optional, for `codex-cli` provider) — [Install](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- **OpenCode CLI** (optional, for `opencode-cli` provider) — [Install](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://swarmclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
npm install
npm run dev
```

On first launch, SwarmClaw will:
1. Generate an **access key** and display it in the terminal
2. Save it to `.env.local`
3. Show a first-time setup screen in the browser with the key to copy

Open `http://localhost:3456` (or your machine's IP for mobile access). Enter the access key, set your name, and you're in.

## Configuration

All config lives in `.env.local` (auto-generated):

```
ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>       # Auth key for the dashboard
CREDENTIAL_SECRET=<auto-generated> # AES-256 encryption key for stored credentials
```

Data is stored in `data/swarmclaw.db` (SQLite with WAL mode), `data/memory.db` (agent memory with FTS5 + vector embeddings), and `data/logs.db` (execution audit trail). Back the `data/` directory up if you care about your sessions, agents, and credentials. Existing JSON file data is auto-migrated to SQLite on first run.

| OpenClaw | Remote Agent | Connects to a remote [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) instance via its `/v1` API. |
| Custom | API | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Add via Providers sidebar. |

### OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an open-source autonomous AI agent that runs on your own devices. SwarmClaw has first-class OpenClaw support — add any number of remote OpenClaw instances as providers and orchestrate them all from one place.

To connect an OpenClaw instance:

1. Enable the HTTP endpoint on OpenClaw:
   ```bash
   openclaw config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
   launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway
   ```
2. In SwarmClaw, select **OpenClaw** as the provider when creating a session or agent
3. Enter the endpoint URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:18789/v1`)
4. Optionally add a Bearer token if your OpenClaw instance requires authentication

Each agent can point to a different OpenClaw instance — this is how you manage a **swarm of OpenClaws** from a single dashboard.

SwarmClaw normalizes common endpoint forms automatically:
- `ws://host:18789` → `http://host:18789/v1`
- `http://host:18789` → `http://host:18789/v1`
- `http://host:18789/v1/chat/completions` → `http://host:18789/v1`

Validate connectivity/auth with:

```bash
swarmclaw providers openclaw-health --query endpoint=ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --query credentialId=cred_openclaw
```

## Chat Connectors

Bridge any agent to a chat platform:

| Platform | Library | Setup |
|-|-|-|
| Discord | discord.js | Bot token + channel IDs |
| Slack | @slack/bolt | Bot token + app token (Socket Mode) |
| Telegram | grammy | Bot token from @BotFather |
| WhatsApp | baileys | QR code pairing (shown in browser) |

Connector sessions preserve attachment visibility in chat context:
- WhatsApp media is decoded and persisted to `/api/uploads/...` when possible
- Telegram and Slack attachments are downloaded to uploads when possible
- Discord attachments are captured as media metadata/URLs

Agents automatically suppress replies to simple acknowledgments ("ok", "thanks", thumbs-up, etc.) via a `NO_MESSAGE` response — conversations feel natural without a forced reply to every message. This is handled at the connector layer, so agents can return `NO_MESSAGE` as their response content and the platform won't deliver anything to the channel.

For proactive outreach, `connector_message_tool` supports text plus optional `imageUrl` / `fileUrl` / `mediaPath` (local file path) payloads. All four platforms (WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Telegram) support local file sending via `mediaPath` with auto-detected MIME types.

## Agent Tools

Agents can use the following tools when enabled:

| Tool | Description |
|-|-|
| Shell | Execute commands in the session working directory |
| Process | Control long-running shell commands (`process_tool`) |
| Files | Read, write, list, and send files |
| Copy/Move/Delete File | Optional file ops (`copy_file`, `move_file`, `delete_file`) configurable per agent/session (`delete_file` is off by default) |
| Edit File | Search-and-replace editing (exact match required) |
| Web Search | Search the web via DuckDuckGo HTML scraping |
| Web Fetch | Fetch and extract text content from URLs (uses cheerio) |
| CLI Delegation | Delegate complex tasks to Claude Code, Codex CLI, or OpenCode CLI |
| Browser | Playwright-powered web browsing via MCP (navigate, click, type, screenshot, PDF) |
| Memory | Store and retrieve long-term memories with FTS5 + vector search, file references, image attachments, and linked memory graph traversal |

### Platform Tools

Agents with platform tools enabled can manage the SwarmClaw instance:

| Tool | Description |
|-|-|
| Manage Agents | List, create, update, delete agents |
| Manage Tasks | Create and manage task board items with agent assignment |
| Manage Schedules | Create cron, interval, or one-time scheduled jobs |
| Manage Skills | List, create, update reusable skill definitions |
| Manage Documents | Upload/search/get/delete indexed docs for lightweight RAG workflows |
| Manage Webhooks | Register external webhook endpoints that trigger agent sessions |
| Manage Connectors | Manage chat platform bridges |
| Manage Sessions | Enable `sessions_tool` for list/history/status/send/spawn/stop, plus `context_status` and `context_summarize` for context window management |
| Manage Secrets | Store and retrieve encrypted reusable secrets |

Enable tools per-session or per-agent in the UI. CLI providers (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) handle tools natively through their own CLI.
OpenClaw provider capabilities are also managed remotely in OpenClaw itself, so local Tools/Platform toggles are hidden for OpenClaw agents.

## Starter Skills (URL Import)

Import these directly in **Skills → Import via URL**:

- `https://swarmclaw.ai/skills/openclaw-swarmclaw-bridge/SKILL.md`
- `https://swarmclaw.ai/skills/swarmclaw-bootstrap/SKILL.md`

## Cost Tracking

Token usage and estimated costs are tracked per message for API-based providers (Anthropic, OpenAI). After each response, a badge in the chat header shows token count and estimated cost.

- **API endpoint:** `GET /api/usage` — returns usage summary by session and provider
- **Data:** Stored in `data/swarmclaw.db` (usage table)
- Cost estimates use published model pricing (updated manually in `src/lib/server/cost.ts`)

## Background Daemon

The daemon auto-processes queued tasks from the scheduler on a 30-second interval. It also runs recurring health checks that detect stale heartbeat sessions and can send proactive WhatsApp alerts when issues are detected. Toggle the daemon from the sidebar indicator or via API.

- **API:** `GET /api/daemon` (status), `POST /api/daemon` with `{"action": "start"}` or `{"action": "stop"}`
- Auto-starts on boot if queued tasks are found

## Main Agent Loop

For autonomous long-running missions, enable the **Main Loop** on a session. This lets an agent pursue a goal continuously with heartbeat-driven progress checks and automatic followups.

- **Heartbeat prompts:** `SWARM_MAIN_MISSION_TICK` triggers on each heartbeat, giving the agent its goal, status, and pending events
- **Auto-followup:** When an agent returns `[MAIN_LOOP_META] {"follow_up":true}`, the loop schedules another tick after `delay_sec`
- **Mission state:** Tracks `goal`, `status` (idle/progress/blocked/ok), `summary`, `nextAction`, `autonomyMode` (assist/autonomous), and pending events
- **Autonomy modes:**
  - `autonomous`: Agent executes safe actions without confirmation, only asks when blocked by permissions/credentials
  - `assist`: Agent asks before irreversible external actions (sending messages, purchases, account mutations)
- **API:** `POST /api/sessions/[id]/main-loop` with `{"tick":true}` to trigger a mission tick
- **CLI:** `swarmclaw sessions main-loop --session-id <id>` (via daemon schedule)

Use this for background agents that should "keep working" on a goal until blocked or complete.

## Loop Modes

Configure loop behavior in **Settings → Runtime & Loop Controls**:

- **Bounded**: fixed max steps for agent and orchestrator loops (default behavior)
- **Ongoing**: loops keep iterating until they hit your safety cap and optional runtime limit

You can also tune shell timeout, Claude Code delegation timeout, and CLI provider process timeout from the same settings panel.

## CLI Troubleshooting

- **Claude delegate returns no output or fails quickly:** verify Claude auth on the host with:
  - `claude auth status`
  - If not logged in: `claude auth login` (or `claude setup-token`)
- **Claude delegate times out:** increase **Claude Code Timeout (sec)** in Settings.
- **Codex fails outside a git repo:** SwarmClaw now uses `--skip-git-repo-check`, but if login is missing run:
  - `codex login`
  - `codex login status`
- **CLI provider errors are now surfaced in chat:** non-zero exits and streamed error events are emitted as chat errors instead of failing silently.

## Voice & Heartbeat

Configure these in **Settings**:

- **Voice** — set `ElevenLabs API Key`, `ElevenLabs Voice ID`, and `Speech Recognition Language`
- **Heartbeat** — set `Heartbeat Interval (Seconds)` and `Heartbeat Prompt` for ongoing session pings

Heartbeat pings are internal checks for ongoing sessions. If there's no new status, the assistant returns `HEARTBEAT_OK`; otherwise it returns a concise progress update and next step. In chat UI, heartbeat entries render as compact expandable cards and consecutive heartbeat streaks are collapsed to the latest item.

## Embeddings & Hybrid Memory Search

Enable semantic search for agent memory by configuring an embedding provider in Settings:

- **Local (Free)** — runs `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` directly in Node.js via HuggingFace Transformers. No API key, no cost, works offline. Model downloads once (~23MB).
- **OpenAI** — uses `text-embedding-3-small` (requires API key)
- **Ollama** — uses local models like `nomic-embed-text`

When enabled, new memories get vector embeddings. Search uses both FTS5 keyword matching and cosine similarity, merging results for better recall.

## Model Failover

Agents and sessions can have **fallback credentials**. If the primary API key gets a 401, 429, or 500 error, SwarmClaw automatically retries with the next credential. Configure fallback keys in the agent builder UI.

## Plugins

Extend agent behavior with JS plugins. Three ways to install:

1. **Marketplace** — Browse and install approved plugins from Settings → Plugins → Marketplace
2. **URL** — Install from any HTTPS URL via Settings → Plugins → Install from URL
3. **Manual** — Drop `.js` files into `data/plugins/`

### Plugin Format (SwarmClaw)

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  description: 'What it does',
  hooks: {
    beforeAgentStart: async ({ session, message }) => { /* ... */ },
    afterAgentComplete: async ({ session, response }) => { /* ... */ },
    beforeToolExec: async ({ toolName, input }) => { /* ... */ },
    afterToolExec: async ({ toolName, input, output }) => { /* ... */ },
    onMessage: async ({ session, message }) => { /* ... */ },
  },
}
```

### OpenClaw Plugin Compatibility

SwarmClaw natively supports the OpenClaw plugin format. Drop an OpenClaw plugin into `data/plugins/` and it works automatically — lifecycle hooks are mapped:

| OpenClaw Hook | SwarmClaw Hook |
|-|-|
| `onAgentStart` | `beforeAgentStart` |
| `onAgentComplete` | `afterAgentComplete` |
| `onToolCall` | `beforeToolExec` |
| `onToolResult` | `afterToolExec` |
| `onMessage` | `onMessage` |

Plugin API: `GET /api/plugins`, `POST /api/plugins`, `GET /api/plugins/marketplace`, `POST /api/plugins/install`.

## Deploy to a VPS

### Direct (pm2 + Caddy)

```bash
# On your VPS
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
npm install
npm run build

# Run with pm2
sudo npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name swarmclaw -- start
pm2 save && pm2 startup
```

Point a reverse proxy (Caddy or nginx) at `localhost:3456` for TLS. See the [full deployment guide](https://swarmclaw.ai/docs/deployment).

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
docker compose up -d
```

Data is persisted in `data/` and `.env.local` via volume mounts. Updates: `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`.

### Updating

SwarmClaw has a built-in update checker — a banner appears in the sidebar when new commits are available, with a one-click update button. Your data in `data/` and `.env.local` is never touched by updates.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server on 0.0.0.0:3456
npm run dev:webpack  # Fallback to webpack dev server (if Turbopack crashes)
npm run dev:clean    # Clear .next cache then restart dev server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run start:standalone # Start standalone server after build
npm run lint         # ESLint
```

The dev server binds to `0.0.0.0` so you can access it from your phone on the same network.

### Turbopack Panic Recovery

If you see a Turbopack panic like `Failed to lookup task type` or missing `.sst/.meta` files:

```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev:clean
```

If it still reproduces, use webpack mode:

```bash
npm run dev:webpack
```

## CLI

SwarmClaw ships a full-featured CLI with complete API coverage:

```bash
# show command help
npm run cli -- --help

# or run the executable directly
node ./bin/swarmclaw.js --help
```
