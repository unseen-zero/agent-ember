# SwarmClaw

Self-hosted AI agent orchestration dashboard. Manage multiple AI providers, orchestrate agent swarms, schedule tasks, and bridge agents to chat platforms — all from a single mobile-friendly interface.

Inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw).

> **v0.1 — Early Alpha.** This is a personal project being open-sourced. Expect rough edges, breaking changes, and incomplete features. Contributions welcome.

## Security Warning

SwarmClaw can spawn **Claude Code CLI** processes with full shell access on your machine. This means agents can read, write, and execute anything your user account can. **Do not run this on a shared server or expose it to the public internet without understanding the risks.**

- Always use the access key authentication (generated on first run)
- Never expose port 3456 without a reverse proxy + TLS
- Review agent system prompts before giving them shell or browser tools

## Features

- **Multi-Provider Chat** — Claude CLI, OpenAI, Anthropic API, Ollama, OpenClaw, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints (OpenRouter, Together, Groq, etc.)
- **OpenClaw Integration** — Connect to remote [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) instances as providers. Control a swarm of autonomous AI agents from a single dashboard
- **Agent Builder** — Create agents with custom personalities (soul), system prompts, tools, and skills
- **Orchestration** — Multi-agent workflows powered by LangGraph with automatic sub-agent routing
- **Task Board** — Queue and track agent tasks with status, comments, and results
- **Scheduling** — Cron-based agent scheduling with human-friendly presets
- **Chat Connectors** — Bridge agents to Discord, Slack, Telegram, and WhatsApp
- **Skills System** — Discover skills from `~/.claude/skills/` and assign them to agents
- **Memory** — Per-agent and per-session memory storage
- **Secrets Vault** — Encrypted storage for API keys and service tokens
- **Custom Providers** — Add any OpenAI-compatible API as a provider
- **Mobile-First UI** — Responsive glass-themed dark interface, works on phone and desktop

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 20+
- **npm** 10+
- **Claude Code CLI** (optional, for `claude-cli` provider) — [Install](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
npm install
npm run dev
```

On first launch, SwarmClaw will:
1. Generate an **access key** and display it in the terminal
2. Save it to `.env.local`
3. Show a first-time setup screen in the browser with the key to copy

Open `http://localhost:3456` (or your machine's IP for mobile access). Enter the access key, set your name, and you're in.

## Configuration

All config lives in `.env.local` (auto-generated):

```
ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>       # Auth key for the dashboard
CREDENTIAL_SECRET=<auto-generated> # AES-256 encryption key for stored credentials
```

Data is stored in `data/` as JSON files. Back this directory up if you care about your sessions, agents, and credentials.

## Providers

| Provider | Type | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| Claude CLI | Subprocess | Spawns `claude` with `--output-format stream-json`. Requires Claude Code installed. |
| Anthropic | API | Direct API calls. Requires API key. |
| OpenAI | API | GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini, etc. Requires API key. |
| OpenClaw | Remote Agent | Connects to a remote [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) instance via its `/v1` API. |
| Ollama | Local | Connects to `localhost:11434`. No API key needed. |
| Custom | API | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Add via Providers sidebar. |

### OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an open-source autonomous AI agent that runs on your own devices. SwarmClaw has first-class OpenClaw support — add any number of remote OpenClaw instances as providers and orchestrate them all from one place.

To connect an OpenClaw instance:

1. Enable the HTTP endpoint in your OpenClaw config (`gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled: true`)
2. In SwarmClaw, select **OpenClaw** as the provider when creating a session or agent
3. Enter the endpoint URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:18789/v1`)
4. Optionally add a Bearer token if your OpenClaw instance requires authentication

Each agent can point to a different OpenClaw instance — this is how you manage a **swarm of OpenClaws** from a single dashboard.

## Chat Connectors

Bridge any agent to a chat platform:

| Platform | Library | Setup |
|-|-|-|
| Discord | discord.js | Bot token + channel IDs |
| Slack | @slack/bolt | Bot token + app token (Socket Mode) |
| Telegram | grammy | Bot token from @BotFather |
| WhatsApp | baileys | QR code pairing (shown in browser) |

## Deploy to a VPS

### Direct (pm2 + Caddy)

```bash
# On your VPS
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
npm install
npm run build

# Run with pm2
sudo npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name swarmclaw -- start
pm2 save && pm2 startup
```

Point a reverse proxy (Caddy or nginx) at `localhost:3456` for TLS. See the [full deployment guide](https://swarmclaw.ai/docs/deployment).

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
docker compose up -d
```

Data is persisted in `data/` and `.env.local` via volume mounts. Updates: `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`.

### Updating

SwarmClaw has a built-in update checker — a banner appears in the sidebar when new commits are available, with a one-click update button. Your data in `data/` and `.env.local` is never touched by updates.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server on 0.0.0.0:3456
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
```

The dev server binds to `0.0.0.0` so you can access it from your phone on the same network.
