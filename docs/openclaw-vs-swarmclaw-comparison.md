## Key Differences

### 1. Architecture Philosophy

**OpenClaw**: Gateway-centric
- Single control plane via WebSocket (`ws://127.0.0.1:18789`)
- Pi AI agent bundled as the default/only agent runtime
- All channels connect to the gateway
- Companion apps connect to the gateway
- Designed for personal, single-user use

**SwarmClaw**: Dashboard-centric
- Web UI as the primary interface
- Multiple agent providers (Claude, Codex, OpenAI, etc.)
- Task queue + daemon for background execution
- API-first with REST endpoints
- Designed for multi-agent orchestration

### 2. Channel Depth vs Breadth

**OpenClaw**: Depth
- Fewer channels but deeper integration
- Full media support (images, audio, video, documents)
- Typing indicators, presence
- Channel-specific features (BlueBubbles for iMessage, etc.)
- Voice note transcription hooks

**SwarmClaw**: Breadth
- More providers but lighter channel integration
- Text-focused connector layer
- Media receiving works, sending limited
- Missing several major channels (iMessage, Signal, Teams, etc.)

### 3. Agent Runtime

**OpenClaw**: Pi AI
- Bundled, single agent model
- RPC mode with tool streaming
- Optimized for personal assistant workflows
- Simpler mental model

**SwarmClaw**: Multi-provider
- Choose from 15+ LLM providers
- CLI delegation (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode)
- Agent builder with custom souls
- Task assignment to specific agents
- More complex but more flexible

### 4. Companion Apps

**OpenClaw**: Native apps
- macOS menu bar app with voice wake
- iOS/Android nodes with Canvas support
- Camera, screen recording, notifications

- Always-on voice listening

**SwarmClaw**: Web-only
- Mobile-friendly responsive web UI
- No native apps
- No voice integration (except TTS settings)
- Canvas not implemented

### 5. Security Model

**OpenClaw**: Sandboxed execution
- Main session has full access
- Non-main sessions can run in Docker sandbox
- Per-session elevated bash toggle
- DM pairing for unknown senders

**SwarmClaw**: Per-session permissions
- Tool toggle per session/agent
- Secrets vault for sensitive data
- Access key authentication
- No sandboxing/Docker isolation

   - Process in connector layer before agent

5. **Typing indicators**
   - Send typing state to channels when agent is processing
   - Use channel APIs (Telegram, Discord support this)

6. **Presence system**
   - Track online/offline status
   - Show in dashboard

### Phase 3: Companion Experience

7. **Canvas implementation**
   - A2UI-style visual workspace
   - Agent-driven UI updates

8. **Mobile apps**
   - Start with web-first PWA
   - Consider React Native for native features

9. **Voice wake**
   - Browser-based wake word detection
   - Integration with TTS for talk mode

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features

10. **Signal connector**
    - Add signal-cli integration

## Code-Level Differences (To Be Documented)

This section should be filled in after a deep code review:

- Session model implementation differences
- Tool execution patterns
- Agent loop architecture
- Channel protocol handling
- Memory/context management
- Plugin/skill architecture

---

## Conclusion

**OpenClaw** excels at:
- Personal AI assistant experience
- Mobile and voice integration
- Channel depth (media, typing, notifications)
- Native companion apps

**SwarmClaw** excels at:
- Multi-provider orchestration
- Task management and queuing
- Agent customization
- Web dashboard experience

The gap is primarily in **channel depth** (media, typing, presence) and **companion apps** (iOS, Android, macOS). The good news: these are additive features that don't require architectural changes. Start with media sending, then move to voice and native apps.
